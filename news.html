                In the wake of the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case, the court had been moved by advocate Saxena to seek proper measures to ensure womenâ€™s safety at public places. Unfortunate as it is, the Supreme Court expressed remorse over the victims of sexual assault being socially boycotted and treated as untouchables and the harassment that they are often subjected to.

                NEW DELHI: A video of a woman, probably a native of Japan, went viral on social media in which a gang could be seen groping and forcefully applying colours on her face and body.
                In a 24-second video clip of the incident, which went viral on social media, the woman could be seen yelling at at least 5-6 ruffians who forcefully smeared her with colours. A man even smashed an egg on her head while another used blue-coloured foam spray to paint her body.
